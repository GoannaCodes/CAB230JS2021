## Language
JS is a C-like languqage that was originally used for scripting in client side web pages.\
There is a very permissive approach to type and variable use as mixing types can prove fatal.

### Comments
`/* */` are used for multiline comments\
`//` are used for single-line comments
### Number declaration
```
let x = 3.14;
const y = 67;
y = 23; //error - can't reassign const variables
``` 

### String declaration
```
let hello = "Hello, world!";
let Hello = "Hello, world!";
```

### Boolean
```
let success = true;
let failure = false;
```
