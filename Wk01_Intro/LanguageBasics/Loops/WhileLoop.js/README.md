## While Loop
Loops through a block of code as long as the condition is true. 
Considered pre-test as condition is checked before executing loop
```
while (condition) {
  //code block to be executed
}
```
## Do-while Loop
Variant of the while loop. 
Considered post-test as code block is executed once before checking if condition is true.
As long as the condition is true, the loop will be repeated.
```
do {
  //code to be executed
} while (condition)
```
