### For Loop
The for loop has the following syntax:
```
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
Statement 1 is executed once; before the execution of the code block - usually declaring counter
Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block - determines how many times the loop is executed
Statement 3 is executed at the end of every iteration
