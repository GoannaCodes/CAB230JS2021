## JavaScript and Multitasking
JavaScript is single threaded (can only do one thing at a time).
  - process thread - statements being executed
  - event loop - keeps track of things that happen

Sometimes there a lots of requests 
  - need to share processor
  - need to understand asynchronous calls
